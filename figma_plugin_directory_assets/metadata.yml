description: "The Official GitLab plugin to seamlessly upload your designs from Figma to GitLab issues.

  Design is larger than designers. Design Management should involve the relevant stakeholders in the conversation on functionality, interaction, UX and much more.
  Now you can start those productive hand-off conversations over designs and source code in GitLab while keeping Figma connected to make any improvements.
  Collaborate seamlessly where the action happens with GitLab’s Figma plugin. 

  Note: this plugin is currently in Beta. At GitLab, we believe that everyone can contribute. If you’d like to request a feature or report a problem, 
  create an issue or submit a merge request at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-figma-plugin"
